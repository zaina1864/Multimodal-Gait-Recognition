# 🦿 Gait Analysis Application

A multimodal gait analysis system combining **sensor-based** and **video-based** models to extract, analyze, and interpret gait features for user identification and movement assessment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 Sensor-based gait recognition using IMU data  
- 🎥 Video-based gait analysis using pose estimation  
- 🔗 Multi-modal fusion for improved accuracy  
- 👤 User registration and verification system  
- 📊 Insightful visualizations of gait data

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following:

- Python **3.8+**
- TensorFlow **2.9**
- Protobuf **3.20**
- Virtual environment setup (recommended)

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaina1864/Multimodal-Gait-Recognition.git
cd Multimodal-Gait-Recognition
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔍 Model Files

Model files are not included in the repo due to size limitations.

1. [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xjIoS_BFGaal67BSdMveRRKEc5V1wOQe?usp=sharing)  
2. Extract if necessary  
3. Place the `model/` folder inside the `Multimodal-Gait-Recognition/` directory

---

## 🧪 Running the Application

```bash
source venv/bin/activate         # Or: venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
```

Open the app in your browser to begin.
